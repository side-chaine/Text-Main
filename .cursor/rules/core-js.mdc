# Core JavaScript Principles

- Adhere to standard JavaScript conventions and maintain code readability.
- When adding significant new functionality, favor creating new, focused methods or classes rather than excessively expanding existing ones (promotes modularity).
- Use descriptive and meaningful variable and function names.
- Add comments only for complex or non-obvious logic (as per general instructions). Avoid redundant comments.
- Ensure User Interface (UI) elements are accessible where applicable.
