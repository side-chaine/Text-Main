# implementation-boundaries.mdc

- All implemented functionality must directly serve the requested task or feature without introducing undiscussed elements.
- Avoid adding hardcoded content (like song lyrics, fixed texts, etc.) that has not been explicitly requested.
- Respect the integrity of user content - never replace or override user-provided data without explicit direction.
- While improvisation within the scope of the requested task is encouraged, all substantial additions must be discussed beforehand.
- When suggesting improvements, clearly present them as suggestions rather than implementing them directly.
- Keep code focused on solving the specific problem at hand rather than anticipating unspecified use cases.
